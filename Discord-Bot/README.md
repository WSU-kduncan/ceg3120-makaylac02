## Setup
* How to get an API Token:
  * When you create your bot, a token can be revealed and there is also an option to regenerate a new token.
* Where to put it to work with the code 
  * We put the token into the .env file
* Dependencies (what packages need to be installed to run the code)
  * We needed to install discord.py, python-dotenv, and I needed to update to python3


## Usage
* Describe what commands you can type in your discord server:
  * I added the !whoami command
* What response will this from your bot?
  * The bot will either say 'I am botty the bot. Who are you?' or, 'Why are you asking?'or, 'Please leave me alone.'

## Research 
* Research some possible solutions to keep the bot running, and discuss why you would think this would work.
  * I believe one solution could be a raspberry pi. They're basically mini computers that can run 24/7 without using too many resours
  * Another solution might just be to buy a server. Kind of like in Minecraft, if you want to have a server running 24/7, you'd have to buy, or rent a server. You could do this for your bot, so that it can continue to run.
